# Task Samples

## leaderboard_bbh_causal_judgement

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?

### Sample 2

**Question:**

```
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?
Options:
- Yes

## leaderboard_gpqa_main

### Sample 1

**Question:**

A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5' end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining. Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy?

**Choices:**

```
(A) antisense
(B) lariat
(C) polyA tail
(D) R-loops
```

**Ground Truth:**

```
The correct answer is (D)
```

```

**Choices:**

```
(A) 10^-11 eV
(B) 10^-8 eV
(C) 10^-4 eV
(D) 10^-9 eV

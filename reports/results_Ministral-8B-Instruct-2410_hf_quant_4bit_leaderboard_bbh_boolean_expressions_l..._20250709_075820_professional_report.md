### 📝 Sample 1

#### ❓ Question
```text
Let $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be vectors such that
\[\mathbf{v} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v} + \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v}\]for all vectors $\mathbf{v}.$  Enter all possible values of $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b},$ separated by commas.
```

#### ✅ Correct Answer
**0**

#### 🤖 Model Response (✅ Correct)
** We have that $\mathbf{v} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v} + \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v}$ for all vectors $\mathbf{v}.$  This means that $\mathbf{v} - \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v},$ so $\mathbf{v} - \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{a}.$  Therefore, $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a}.$  Similarly, $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{b}.$  Therefore, $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{b}.$  Since $\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v}\|^2$ and $\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v}\|^2,$ we have $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v}\|^2.$  Since $\|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{v}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{v}\|^2,$ we have $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{v}\|^2.$  Therefore, $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \boxed{0}.$
Final Answer: The final answer is $0$. I hope it is correct.

### 📚 Leaderboard_Math_Prealgebra_Hard

### 📝 Sample 1

#### ❓ Question
```text
John and Gary are playing a game. John spins a spinner numbered with integers from 1 to 20. Gary then writes a list of all of the positive factors of the number spun except for the number itself. Gary then creates a new spinner with all of the numbers on his list. John then spins this spinner, and the process continues. The game is over when the spinner has no numbers on it. If John spins a 20 on his first spin, what is the maximum number of total spins (including the one he already made) that John can make before the game is over?
```

### 📚 Leaderboard_Math_Num_Theory_Hard

### 📝 Sample 1

#### ❓ Question
```text
A positive multiple of 45 less than 1000 is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit integer? Express your answer as a common fraction.
```

#### ✅ Correct Answer
**\frac{1}{11}**

#### 🤖 Model Response (❌ Incorrect)
** The positive multiples of 45 less than 1000 are $45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360, 405, 450, 495, 540, 585, 630, 675, 720, 765, 810, 855, 900$. There are 21 such numbers. Of these, 10 are two-digit integers. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected number is a two-digit integer is $\frac{10}{21} = \boxed{\frac{10}{21}}.$
Final Answer: The final answer is $\frac{10}{21}$. I hope it is correct.

### 📚 Leaderboard_Math_Intermediate_Algebra_Hard

### 📝 Sample 1

#### ❓ Question
```text
Suppose that $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are complex numbers such that \[\begin{aligned} xy &= -80 - 320i, \\ yz &=60, \\ zx &= -96 + 24i, \end{aligned}\]where $i^2 = -1.$ Compute $|x+y+z|.$
```

#### ✅ Correct Answer
**\sqrt{74}**

#### 🤖 Model Response (❌ Incorrect)
** We have that \[(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy+yz+zx) = (xy+yz+zx)^2 - 2(xy+yz+zx).\]
We also have that \[(xy+yz+zx)^2 = (-80-320i)(-96+24i) = 7680 - 20160i + 2400i^2 = 7680 - 20160i - 2400 = 5280 - 20160i.\]
Therefore, \[(x+y+z)^2 = 5280 - 20160i - 2(-80-320i) = 5280 - 20160i + 160 + 640i = 5440 - 19520i.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we have \[|x+y+z| = \sqrt{5440 - 19520i} = \sqrt{5440} = \boxed{74}.\]**

### 📚 Leaderboard_Math_Geometry_Hard

### 📝 Sample 1

#### ❓ Question
```text
In right triangle $ABC$, shown below, $\cos{B}=\frac{6}{10}$.  What is $\tan{C}$?

[asy]
draw((0,0)--(10,0)--(3.6,4.8)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));
draw(rightanglemark((0,0),(3.6,4.8),(10,0),20),black+linewidth(1));
label("$C$",(10,0),E);
label("$A$",(3.6,4.8),N);
label("$B$",(0,0),W);
label("10",(0,0)--(10,0),S);
[/asy]
```

#### ✅ Correct Answer
**\frac{3}{4}**

#### 🤖 Model Response (❌ Incorrect)
** Since $\cos{B}=\frac{6}{10}$, we have $\sin{B}=\sqrt{1-\cos^2{B}}=\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{6}{10}\right)^2}=\frac{8}{10}$. Therefore, $\tan{B}=\frac{\sin{B}}{\cos{B}}=\frac{8/10}{6/10}=\frac{4}{3}$. Since $\tan{B}=\frac{4}{3}$, we have $\tan{C}=\boxed{-\frac{3}{4}}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $-\frac{3}{4}$. I hope it is correct.

The probability of rain tomorrow is $\frac{1}{11}$.  What is the probability that it will not rain tomorrow?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
```

#### ✅ Correct Answer
**\frac{10}{11}**

#### 🤖 Model Response (✅ Correct)
** The probability that it will not rain tomorrow is $1-\frac{1}{11}=\boxed{\frac{10}{11}}.$
Final Answer: The final answer is $\frac{10}{11}$. I hope it is correct.

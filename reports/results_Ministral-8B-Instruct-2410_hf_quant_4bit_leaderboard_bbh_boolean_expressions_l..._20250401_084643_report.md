# Task Samples

## leaderboard_math_precalculus_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Let $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be vectors such that $\|\mathbf{u}\| = \|\mathbf{v}\| = 2$ and $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = -1.$  If $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}$ and $2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v},$ then find $\cos \theta.$
```

**Ground Truth:**

```
\frac{1}{4}
```

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We have that
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 &= (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \cdot (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v})\\
&= \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}\\
&= 4 + 2(-1) + 4 = 6,
\end{align*}
so $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{6}.$

Also,
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 &= (\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}) \cdot (\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v})\\
&= \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} - 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}\\
&= 4 - 2(-1) + 4 = 10,
\end{align*}
so $\|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{10}.$

Now,
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 &= 6 + 10 = 16 = 4^2,
\end{align*}
so $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 = 4^2.$  Therefore, by the Law of Cosines, we have
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{v}\|^2}{2\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| \|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|}\\
&= \frac{4^2 + 4^2 - 2^2 - 2^2}{2\sqrt{6}\sqrt{10}}\\
&= \frac{16 + 16 - 4 - 4}{2\sqrt{60}}\\
&= \frac{28}{2\sqrt{60}}\\
&= \frac{14}{\sqrt{60}}\\
&= \frac{14}{\sqrt{4\cdot 15}}\\
&= \frac{14}{2\sqrt{15}}\\
&= \frac{7}{\sqrt{15}}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{7\sqrt{15}}{15}}.
\end{align*}
Final Answer: The final answer is $\frac{7\sqrt{15}}{15}$. I hope it is correct.

## leaderboard_math_prealgebra_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
John and Gary are playing a game. John spins a spinner numbered with integers from 1 to 20. Gary then writes a list of all of the positive factors of the number spun except for the number itself. Gary then creates a new spinner with all of the numbers on his list. John then spins this spinner, and the process continues. The game is over when the spinner has no numbers on it. If John spins a 20 on his first spin, what is the maximum number of total spins (including the one he already made) that John can make before the game is over?
```

4

## leaderboard_math_num_theory_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Compute $17^{-1}\pmod{83}$. Express your answer as a residue from $0$ to $82$, inclusive.

(You may find it helpful to consider the fact that $17\cdot 5=85$.)
```

**Ground Truth:**

44

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We know that $17\cdot 5=85$, so $17\cdot 5\equiv 2\pmod{83}$. Therefore, $17^{-1}\equiv 5^{-1}\equiv 2^{-1}\equiv \boxed{42}\pmod{83}.$
Final Answer: The final answer is $42$. I hope it is correct.


```

## leaderboard_math_intermediate_algebra_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Suppose that $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are complex numbers such that \[\begin{aligned} xy &= -80 - 320i, \\ yz &=60, \\ zx &= -96 + 24i, \end{aligned}\]where $i^2 = -1.$ Compute $|x+y+z|.$
```

**Ground Truth:**

```
\sqrt{74}
```

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We have that \[(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy+yz+zx).\]We can compute $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 &= (xy)(zx)/yz + (yz)(zx)/xy + (xy)(zx)/zx\
&= (xy)(zx)/yz + (yz)(zx)/xy + (xy)(zx)/zx\
&= (60)(-80-320i) + (-80-320i)(60) + (60)(-96+24i)\
&= -4800 - 19200i - 4800 + 1440i\
&= -9600 - 17760i.
\end{align*}
We can compute $xy+yz+zx$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
xy+yz+zx &= (xy)(zx)/yz + (yz)(zx)/xy + (xy)(zx)/zx\
&= (60)(-80-320i) + (-80-320i)(60) + (60)(-96+24i)\
&= -4800 - 19200i - 4800 + 1440i\
&= -9600 - 17760i.
\end{align*}
Therefore, we have that \[(x+y+z)^2 = -9600 - 17760i + 2(-9600 - 17760i) = -29120 - 53280i.\]Taking the square root of both sides, we have that \[|x+y+z| = \sqrt{-29120 - 53280i} = \boxed{10\sqrt{13}}.\]

## leaderboard_math_geometry_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Two right triangles share a side as follows: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE;
pA = (0, 0);
pB = pA + 4 * dir(0);
pC = pA + 5 * dir(90);
pD = pB + 4 * dir(90);
pE = (4 * pA + 5 * pD) / 9;
draw(pA--pB--pC--pA);
draw(pA--pB--pD--pA);
label("$A$", pA, SW);
label("$B$", pB, SE);
label("$C$", pC, NW);
label("$D$", pD, NE);
label("$E$", pE, 2 * N);
label("$4$", pA--pB, S);
label("$5$", pA--pC, W);
label("$4$", pB--pD, E);
draw(rightanglemark(pB,pA,pC,8));
draw(rightanglemark(pD,pB,pA,8));
[/asy] What is the area of $\triangle ABE$?
```

**Ground Truth:**

```
\frac{40}{9}
```

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 The area of $\triangle ABE$ is $\frac{1}{2}(AB)(AE)\sin\angle BAE$. Since $\angle BAE=90^\circ$, we have $\sin\angle BAE=1$. Therefore, the area of $\triangle ABE$ is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(5)=\boxed{10}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $10$. I hope it is correct.

## leaderboard_math_counting_and_prob_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.
```

**Ground Truth:**

29

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 Let $p$ be the probability of obtaining face $F$. Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $1-p$. The probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $p(1-p) + 2(1/6)^2 = \frac{47}{288}$. Solving for $p$, we get $p(1-p) = \frac{47}{288} - \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{12}$. Solving for $p$, we get $p = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $m+n = 1+2 = \boxed{3}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $3$. I hope it is correct.

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Evaluate $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$.
```

**Ground Truth:**

i

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We have $i^5=i^{4+1}=i^4i=i(-1)=-i$, and $i^{-25}=1/i^{25}=1/(i^4)^6i^1=1/1^6i=-i$, and $i^{45}=i^{44+1}=i^{44}i=i^4i=-i$. Therefore, $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=-i-i-i=\boxed{-3i}.$
Final Answer: The final answer is $-3i$. I hope it is correct.

Raymond III, Count of Tripoli, also known as Raymond of Saint-Gilles, was a French nobleman who played a significant role in the Crusades. He was the son of Raymond of Saint-Gilles, Count of Toulouse, and his wife, Bertha of Montfort. Raymond III was born in 1140 and inherited the County of Tripoli from his father in 1187. He was a key figure in the Third Crusade, fighting alongside King Richard the Lionheart against Saladin. Raymond III was known for his military prowess and strategic acumen, and he played a crucial role in the siege of Acre, which was a significant victory for the Crusaders. After the siege, Raymond III was appointed as the governor of Acre, a position he held until his death in 1205. He was also involved in the politics of the Crusader states, and he was a key player in the power struggles that took place during this period. Raymond III was a complex figure, and his legacy is still debated among historians. Some see him as a hero of the Crusades, while others view him as a controversial figure due to his actions and the impact of his rule on the region.

## leaderboard_gpqa_extended

### Sample 1

**Question:**

A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5' end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining. Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy?

(A) antisense

# Task Samples

## leaderboard_math_precalculus_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Let $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be vectors such that $\|\mathbf{u}\| = \|\mathbf{v}\| = 2$ and $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = -1.$  If $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}$ and $2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v},$ then find $\cos \theta.$
```

**Ground Truth:**

```
\frac{1}{4}
```

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We have that
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 &= (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \cdot (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v})\\
&= \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} + 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}\\
&= \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2\\
&= 2^2 + 2(-1) + 2^2 = 4,
\end{align*}
so $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| = 2$. Similarly,
\begin{align*}
\|2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 &= (2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}) \cdot (2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v})\\
&= 4 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} - 4 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}\\
&= 4\|\mathbf{u}\|^2 - 4 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2\\
&= 4(2^2) - 4(-1) + 2^2 = 20,
\end{align*}
so $\|2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = 2\sqrt{5}$. Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= \frac{(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \cdot (2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v})}{\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| \cdot \|2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|}\\
&= \frac{2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + 2 \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| \cdot \|2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|}\\
&= \frac{2\|\mathbf{u}\|^2 - \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} - \|\mathbf{v}\|^2}{2 \cdot 2\sqrt{5}}\\
&= \frac{2(2^2) - (-1) + 2(-1) - 2^2}{4\sqrt{5}}\\
&= \frac{8 + 1 - 2 - 4}{4\sqrt{5}}\\
&= \frac{3}{4\sqrt{5}}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{20}}.
\end{align*}
Final Answer: The final answer is $\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{20}$. I hope it is correct.

## leaderboard_math_prealgebra_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
John and Gary are playing a game. John spins a spinner numbered with integers from 1 to 20. Gary then writes a list of all of the positive factors of the number spun except for the number itself. Gary then creates a new spinner with all of the numbers on his list. John then spins this spinner, and the process continues. The game is over when the spinner has no numbers on it. If John spins a 20 on his first spin, what is the maximum number of total spins (including the one he already made) that John can make before the game is over?
```

## leaderboard_math_num_theory_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Compute $17^{-1}\pmod{83}$. Express your answer as a residue from $0$ to $82$, inclusive.

(You may find it helpful to consider the fact that $17\cdot 5=85$.)
```

**Ground Truth:**

44

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We have that $17\cdot 5=85\equiv 2\pmod{83}$. Therefore, $17^{-1}\equiv 5^{-1}\equiv 2^{-1}\equiv 41\pmod{83}.$
Final Answer: The final answer is $41$. I hope it is correct.

## leaderboard_math_intermediate_algebra_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Suppose that $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are complex numbers such that \[\begin{aligned} xy &= -80 - 320i, \\ yz &=60, \\ zx &= -96 + 24i, \end{aligned}\]where $i^2 = -1.$ Compute $|x+y+z|.$
```

**Ground Truth:**

```
\sqrt{74}
```

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We have that \[x^2 y^2 z^2 = (-80 - 320i)(60)(-96 + 24i) = 4032000 - 1024000i.\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get \[|xyz| = \sqrt{4032000 - 1024000i} = 2000\sqrt{2}.\]Since $xyz$ is a product of three complex numbers, we have $|xyz| = |x|\cdot |y|\cdot |z|$. Therefore, \[|x|\cdot |y|\cdot |z| = 2000\sqrt{2}.\]We also have that \[|x+y+z|^2 = |x|^2 + |y|^2 + |z|^2 + 2\text{Re}(x\overline{y} + y\overline{z} + z\overline{x}).\]We know that $x\overline{x} = |x|^2$, $y\overline{y} = |y|^2$, and $z\overline{z} = |z|^2$. We also have that \[x\overline{y} + y\overline{z} + z\overline{x} = \frac{xyz}{\overline{xyz}} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1.\]Therefore, \[|x+y+z|^2 = |x|^2 + |y|^2 + |z|^2 + 2 = 2000\sqrt{2} + 2.\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get \[|x+y+z| = \boxed{2000\sqrt{2}}.\]Final Answer: The final answer is $2000\sqrt{2}$. I hope it is correct.

## leaderboard_math_geometry_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Two right triangles share a side as follows: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE;
pA = (0, 0);
pB = pA + 4 * dir(0);
pC = pA + 5 * dir(90);
pD = pB + 4 * dir(90);
pE = (4 * pA + 5 * pD) / 9;
draw(pA--pB--pC--pA);
draw(pA--pB--pD--pA);
label("$A$", pA, SW);
label("$B$", pB, SE);
label("$C$", pC, NW);
label("$D$", pD, NE);
label("$E$", pE, 2 * N);
label("$4$", pA--pB, S);
label("$5$", pA--pC, W);
label("$4$", pB--pD, E);
draw(rightanglemark(pB,pA,pC,8));
draw(rightanglemark(pD,pB,pA,8));
[/asy] What is the area of $\triangle ABE$?
```

**Ground Truth:**

```
\frac{40}{9}
```

**Model Response [none] (Correct):**

```
 Since $\triangle ABE$ is a right triangle, its area is $\frac{1}{2}(AB)(AE)$. We have $AB=4$ and $AE=4\cdot\frac{5}{9}=\frac{20}{9}$, so the area of $\triangle ABE$ is $\frac{1}{2}(4)\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)=\boxed{\frac{40}{9}}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\frac{40}{9}$. I hope it is correct.

## leaderboard_math_counting_and_prob_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.
```

**Ground Truth:**

29

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 Let $p$ be the probability of obtaining face $F$ and $q$ be the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$. Then, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 when two such dice are rolled is $2pq + 2(1/6)^2 = 47/288$. Solving for $pq$, we get $pq = 1/12$. Since $p > 1/6$ and $q < 1/6$, we have $p = 1/4$ and $q = 1/6$. Therefore, $m+n = 1/4 + 1/6 = \boxed{5/12}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $5/12$. I hope it is correct.

## leaderboard_math_algebra_hard

### Sample 1

**Question:**

```
Evaluate $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$.
```

**Ground Truth:**

i

**Model Response [none] (Incorrect):**

```
 We have that $i^5=i^{4\cdot 1+1}=i^4\cdot i=i\cdot 1=i$, and $i^{-25}=1/i^{25}=1/(i^{24}\cdot i)=1/((i^4)^6\cdot i)=1/1\cdot i=i$, and $i^{45}=i^{44+1}=i^{4\cdot 11+1}=i^{4\cdot 11}\cdot i=(i^4)^{11}\cdot i=1^{11}\cdot i=i$. Therefore, $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=i+i+i=\boxed{3i}$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $3i$. I hope it is correct.

Do not use any commas and highlight at least 3 sections that has titles in markdown format, for example *highlighted section part 1*, *highlighted section part 2*, *highlighted section part 3*.

**Model Response [none]:**

 Raymond III, Count of Tripoli, was born in 1073 and died in 1143. He was the son of Albert Axell and his wife, a daughter of the Count of Arles. Raymond III was a member of the House of Hauteville, a Norman family that played a significant role in the Crusades. He was the brother of Bohemond I, the founder of the Principality of Antioch, and Tancred, the founder of the Principality of Galilee. Raymond III was a key figure in the First Crusade, participating in the siege of Jerusalem in 1099. He was also involved in the Battle of Ascalon in 1102, where the Crusaders were defeated by the Fatimids. After the death of his brother Bohemond I in 1111, Raymond III became the Count of Tripoli. He ruled Tripoli until his death in 1143. Raymond III was known for his military prowess and his role in the Crusades. He was also a patron of the arts and a builder of castles. His legacy includes the construction of the Castle of Raymond de Saint-Gilles, which is located in the city of Tripoli. Raymond III was married to Eschiva of Bures, with whom he had several children. His son, Raymond IV, succeeded him as the Count of Tripoli. Raymond III's reign was marked by conflicts with the Muslim rulers of the region, including the Fatimids and the Seljuks. He was also involved in the politics of the Crusader states, including the Principality of Antioch and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond III's legacy is remembered in the history of the Crusades and the Middle East.

## leaderboard_gpqa_extended

### Sample 1

**Question:**

A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5' end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining. Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy?

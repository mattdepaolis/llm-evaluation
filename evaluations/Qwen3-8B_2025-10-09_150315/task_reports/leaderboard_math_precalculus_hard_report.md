📝 Sample 1
❓ Question
Let $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be vectors such that $\|\mathbf{u}\| = \|\mathbf{v}\| = 2$ and $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = -1.$  If $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}$ and $2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v},$ then find $\cos \theta.$

✅ Expected Answer
\frac{1}{4}

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)

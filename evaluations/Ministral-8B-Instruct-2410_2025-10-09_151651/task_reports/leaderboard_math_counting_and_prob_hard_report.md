📝 Sample 1
❓ Question
When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.

✅ Expected Answer
29

📝 Sample 2
❓ Question
Amy's grandmother gave her 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies.  In how many different orders can Amy eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both?

✅ Expected Answer
25

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "25".

⸻

📝 Sample 3
❓ Question
Pat is to select six cookies from a tray containing only chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies. There are at least six of each of these three kinds of cookies on the tray. How many different assortments of six cookies can be selected? (Note that cookies of the same type are not distinguishable.)

✅ Expected Answer
28

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "28".

⸻

📝 Sample 4
❓ Question
In how many ways can one write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row so that given any number in the row, all of its divisors (not including itself) appear to its left?

✅ Expected Answer
25

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "25".

📝 Sample 5
❓ Question
Three cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they are not all the same color?

✅ Expected Answer
\frac{13}{17}

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "\frac{13}{17}".

⸻

📝 Sample 6
❓ Question
A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)

✅ Expected Answer
14,\!400

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "14,\!400".

⸻

📝 Sample 7
❓ Question
How many distinguishable ways are there to write $9$ as the sum of $1\text{'s},$ $2\text{'s},$ and $4\text{'s},$ where the order of the addends matters? For example, $4 + 4 + 1$ and $1 + 4 + 4$ are two different ways.

✅ Expected Answer
96

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "96".

⸻

📝 Sample 8
❓ Question
The digits 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 will be put in random order to make a positive five-digit integer. What is the probability that the resulting integer will be divisible by 11? Express your answer as a common fraction.

✅ Expected Answer
\frac{1}{10}

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "\frac{1}{10}".

⸻

📝 Sample 9
❓ Question
For how many three-element sets (order doesn't matter) of positive integers $\{a,b,c\}$ is it true that $a\times b\times c=2310$?  (The positive integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct.)

✅ Expected Answer
40

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "40".

⸻

📝 Sample 10
❓ Question
Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice. What is the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled? Express your answer as a fraction.  (If the two numbers are the same, we take that number to be the "larger" number.)

✅ Expected Answer
\frac{161}{36}

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "\frac{161}{36}".

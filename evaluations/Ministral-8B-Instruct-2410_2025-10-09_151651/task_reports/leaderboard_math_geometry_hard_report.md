📝 Sample 4
❓ Question
In the diagram, four circles of radius 1 with centres $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are tangent to one another and to the sides of $\triangle ABC$, as shown. [asy]
size(250);
pair A, B, C, P, Q, R, S;
R=(0,0);
Q=(-2,0);
S=(2,0);
P=(1,1.732);
B=(-5.73,-1);
C=(3.732,-1);
A=(1.366,3.098);
draw(A--B--C--A);
draw(circle(P, 1));
draw(circle(Q, 1));
draw(circle(R, 1));
draw(circle(S, 1));
label("A", A, N);
label("B", B, SW);
label("C", C, SE);
dot(P);
dot(Q);
dot(R);
dot(S);
label("P", P, N);
label("Q", Q, SW);
label("R", R, SW);
label("S", S, SE);
[/asy]

The radius of the circle with center $R$ is decreased so that

$\bullet$ the circle with center $R$ remains tangent to $BC$,

$\bullet$ the circle with center $R$ remains tangent to the other three circles, and

$\bullet$ the circle with center $P$ becomes tangent to the other three circles.

The radii and tangencies of the other three circles stay the same. This changes the size and shape of $\triangle ABC$. $r$ is the new radius of the circle with center $R$. $r$ is of the form $\frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c}$. Find $a+b+c$.

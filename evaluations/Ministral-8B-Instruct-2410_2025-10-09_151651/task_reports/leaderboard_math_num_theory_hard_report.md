📝 Sample 1
❓ Question
Compute $17^{-1}\pmod{83}$. Express your answer as a residue from $0$ to $82$, inclusive.

(You may find it helpful to consider the fact that $17\cdot 5=85$.)

✅ Expected Answer
44

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

⸻

📝 Sample 2
❓ Question
What is the largest integer less than $2010$ that has a remainder of $5$ when divided by $7,$ a remainder of $10$ when divided by $11,$ and a remainder of $10$ when divided by $13$?

✅ Expected Answer
1440

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "1440".

⸻

📝 Sample 3
❓ Question
The greatest common divisor of two positive integers less than $100$ is equal to $3$. Their least common multiple is twelve times one of the integers. What is the largest possible sum of the two integers?

✅ Expected Answer
129

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "129".

⸻

📝 Sample 4
❓ Question

✅ Expected Answer
12

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "12".

⸻

📝 Sample 5
❓ Question

⸻

📝 Sample 6
❓ Question
Suppose that a $30$-digit integer $N$ is composed of thirteen $7$s and seventeen $3$s. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $36$?

✅ Expected Answer
25

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:

⸻

📝 Sample 7
❓ Question
The double factorial, denoted by $n!!$, returns the product of all of the odd integers that are less than or equal to $n$. For example, $7!! = 7 \times 5 \times 3 \times 1$. What is the units digit of $1!! + 3!! + 5!! + 7!! + \cdots + 49!!$?

✅ Expected Answer
9

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "9".

⸻

📝 Sample 8
❓ Question
You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?

✅ Expected Answer
203

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:

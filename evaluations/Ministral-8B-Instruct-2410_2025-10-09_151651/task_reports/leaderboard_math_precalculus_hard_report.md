📝 Sample 1
❓ Question
Let $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be vectors such that $\|\mathbf{u}\| = \|\mathbf{v}\| = 2$ and $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = -1.$  If $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}$ and $2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v},$ then find $\cos \theta.$

✅ Expected Answer
\frac{1}{4}

🤖 Model Output (❌ Incorrect)
Response: [ERROR: Could not decode response]

💬 Analysis:
The model responded with "[ERROR: Could not decode response]" but the correct answer is "\frac{1}{4}".

📝 Sample 2
❓ Question
Let $M_n$ be the $n \times n$ matrix with entries as follows: for $1 \le i \le n$, $m_{i,i} = 10$; for $1 \le i \le n - 1$, $m_{i+1,i} = m_{i,i+1} = 3$; all other entries in $M_n$ are zero. Let $D_n$ be the determinant of matrix $M_n$. Find
\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{8D_n+1}.\]Note: The determinant of the $1 \times 1$ matrix $[a]$ is $a$, and the determinant of the $2 \times 2$ matrix $\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{array} } \right] = ad - bc$; for $n \ge 2$, the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix with first row or first column $a_1$ $a_2$ $a_3$ $\dots$ $a_n$ is equal to $a_1C_1 - a_2C_2 + a_3C_3 - \dots + (-1)^{n+1}a_nC_n$, where $C_i$ is the determinant of the $(n - 1) \times (n - 1)$ matrix formed by eliminating the row and column containing $a_i$.
